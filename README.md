## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP

After consulting with the client, and visualising the client's needs and wants, the site provides a smooth layout to display the clients work with a special made logo to reflec the clients personality.  I also made a little motorcycle thumbnail when the page refreshes so customize it for the client since his first love is motorcycles.

## Optimizations


I would like to add a gallery page to display more of the clients work in the future.  This was suggested for this project during consultation, however, at this moment the client did not feel like having an independent page to reflect their work.  Would love to use react to help the designing aspect of the project as well.

## Lessons Learned:

I definitely learn that communication is a huge essential part of delivering what the client wants as well as making the project as smooth as possible without underdoing some thing or overdoing some thing.  You may think adding more features might be something awesome, however, if its not in the client's vision, then you are not delivering what the client needs.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
